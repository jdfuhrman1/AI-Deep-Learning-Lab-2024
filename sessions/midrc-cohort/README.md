# MIDRC - Cohort Building, Downloading, and Using Data for DL

## Monday, December 2, 11:00am - 12:00pm

## Overall Learning Objectives: 
- Learn about the [tools](https://www.midrc.org/tools-1) on midrc.org, including the [metric tree](https://www.midrc.org/performance-metrics-decision-tree) and the [bias awareness tool](https://www.midrc.org/bias-awareness-tool-1).
- Learn how to use MIDRC open APIs to perform cohort building and access image files programmatically in both the MIDRC data commons and across the whole Biomedical Imaging Data Fabric in the MIDRC BIH.
- Learn how to use the MIDRC [stratified sampling tool](https://github.com/MIDRC/Generalized_Stratified_Sampling).

## Course Description:
The Medical Imaging Data and Resource Center (MIDRC) provides tools to help researchers explore and understand data as well as search and access data programmatically. Students will learn how to access these tools and use a Jupyter Notebook example to select cohorts in both the MIDRC data commons and the MIDRC Biomedical Imaging Hub, which aggregates imaging discovery metadata across connected nodes in the Biomedical Imaging Data Fabric.
